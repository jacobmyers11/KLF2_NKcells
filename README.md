This repo is for an analysis of human Bulk RNASeq from an experiment with a treatment X time design. The reads processing used CHURP with the script in ./scripts. The analysis, which is spread through the files in ./r_scripts, uses edgeR, clusterProfiler, minfi, limma, and other packages. It does not include any data or output plots.

Please contact me (jacob_myers@brown.edu) with any questions.
